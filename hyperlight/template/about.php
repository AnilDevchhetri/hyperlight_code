                                        <h4>HyperLight, your go-to-partner for thin-film lithium niobate integrated circuits solutions</h4>
                                        <p>As a leader in the commercialization of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic integrated circuits (PICs), HyperLight provides groundbreaking electro-optic and nonlinear optic solutions with innovative designs and scalable manufacturing processes.  <br><br>
                                            Our expertise spans multiple industries, including data center and telecommunication networks, sensing, LiDAR, analog RF signal, and quantum photonics. We work in close collaboration with our customers, focusing on research and development to make customized and disruptive contributions to the advancement of integrated photonics in TFLN. Our patented designs and proprietary production processes result in electro-optic photonics integrated circuits based on TFLN with ultrahigh performance, meeting the demanding requirements of both low power and high bandwidth applications.
<b>Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, HyperLight spun out of Harvard University and was founded in 2018 with the mission to push the performance boundaries of TFLN integrated circuits for next-generation applications.  </b><br><br>
In the current market, lithium niobate photonics integrated circuits have been underutilized as silicon photonics promises monolithic silicon processing and integration with electronics for dramatic cost and power savings. But the reality is, siliconâ€™s limited electro-optic performance may actually cost more.<br><br>

<b>The HyperLight solution is TFLN. </b>Thin-film lithium niobate offers silicon-like processing for the best and most reliable electro-optic material, providing higher cost-efficiency and power performance against alternatives. HyperLight has strong patent portfolio, delivering customized, scalable solutions for our customers.<br><br>

While we are in pursuit of advancement, <b>it is an integral part of our mission to develop a technology that optimizes the use of energy and natural resources. </b> This is a key pillar both for our company culture and our success. In addition to bringing disruptive capability to our customers using the proven material lithium niobate combined with silicon-like processes, we are also committed to the most sustainable, energy-saving practices to ensure that our collective ecological footprint is as small as possible.
